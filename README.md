## What Type of Broker is Quotex?

Quotex is a Market Making (MM) broker, which means that it acts as a
counterparty to its clients in trading operations. This means that
instead of connecting directly to the market, Quotex acts as an
intermediary and takes the opposite position to its clients.

As a result, Quotex can offer faster order execution speed, tighter
spreads and greater flexibility in terms of the leverage offered.
However, this also means that Quotex has a certain conflict of interest
with their clients, as their profits come from the difference between
the bid and ask price of assets, which could lead to them making
decisions that are not necessarily in the best interests of their
clients.
